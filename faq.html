                    <h3>When is the youth lacrosse season?</h3>
                    <p>Practices typically start in late March, with games taking place on Saturdays in April and May.</p>

                <article class="question">
                    <h3>When and where are practices?</h3>
                    <p>Practice times and locations for the 2026 season are TBD. Those decisions will likely be made around January 2026.</p>
                    <p>For the 2025 season, practices were 4:30-6:30PM, Tuesday through Thursday, for three practices per week. Certain practices were held at Gaffney Lane Elementary, and others at Tumwata Middle School. In other years we've held some practices at Gardiner Middle School.</p>

                    <h3>When are games?</h3>
                    <p>Games are held on Saturdays in April and May, except for Memorial Day weekend.</p>

                    <h3>Are the teams leveled?</h3>
                    <p>Sort of.</p>
                    <p>Our league, <a href="https://www.oregongirlslax.com/" target="_blank">Oregon Girls Lacrosse Association (OGLA)</a>, uses a banding system to group teams together &mdash; within each age bracket &mdash; based on their size and the average experience level of the players.</p>
                    <p>This is meant to make it easier for teams to schedule games against opponents of similar ability, so that those games will be of equal challenge/enjoyment for both teams. However, this doesn't mean that teams are not allowed to schedule matches with opponents from a higher or lower band. Rather, the banding is a piece of information that teams can use to help them create an overall-balanced schedule for the season.</p>

                <article class="question">
                    <h3>What equipment do I need?</h3>
                    <p>All players need: a mouth guard, lacrosse goggles, a lacrosse stick, and cleets that are appropriate for grass and/or turf. Players in girls lacrosse do not utilize the body pads that are used in boys lacrosse. The exception is the goalie position, but the team provides the protective gear that is unique to the goalie position.</p>
                    <p>Lacrosse helmets with integrated goggles are allowed in girls lacrosse, but are optional.</p>

                    <h3>Is loaner gear available?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, we do have some loaner gear available for first year players (sticks and goggles). If you would like to borrow gear, girls can check it out for the season on the first day of practice.</p>
